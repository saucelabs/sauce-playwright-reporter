# sauce-playwright-plugin

This Playwright plugin reports each project to your Sauce Labs account.

## Installation

Install from npm:
```sh
npm install @saucelabs/playwright-reporter
```

### Sauce Labs Credentials

Set the `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables to allow the plugin to report your results to Sauce Labs. Your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key are available from your [dashboard](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings).

## Usage

Add to the default reporter:
```sh
npx playwright test --reporter=line,@saucelabs/playwright-reporter
```

Use only `@saucelabs/playwright-reporter`:
```sh
npx playwright test --reporter=@saucelabs/playwright-reporter
```

You can also configure it using `playwright.config.js`. To do that, add `'@saucelabs/playwright-reporter'` to the reporter section of your configuration:
```js
const config = {
  reporter: [
    ['@saucelabs/playwright-reporter'],
  ],
  // Rest of your config goes here
};
```

### Plugin Configuration

`@saucelabs/playwright-reporter` is configurable through your `playwright.config.js` or `playwright.config.ts` file.

```js
const config = {
  reporter: [
    ['@saucelabs/playwright-reporter', {

      tags: [
        'playwright',
        'demo',
      ],

Some limitations apply to `@saucelabs/playwright-reporter`:
* For Playwright versions before v1.16.3, the Playwright version is not reported to Sauce Labs.
* The browser version is not reported to Sauce Labs.

## Development

### Running integration tests

There are tests included in `tests/integration` where the reporter is referenced
directly.

```sh
$ npm run build
$ cd tests/integration
$ npx playwright test
```

### Running Locally

If you have playwright tests outside of the repo, you can link and install the
reporter to run in your external repo.

```sh
$ npm run build
$ npm link
$ npm link @saucelabs/playwright-reporter
$ npx playwright test --reporter=@saucelabs/playwright-reporter
```

### Debug

After linking with `npm link`, you can run your Playwright tests with the environment variable `DEBUG="@saucelabs/playwright-reporter:*"` to see additional debug output.

```sh
$ DEBUG="@saucelabs/playwright-reporter:*" npx playwright test --reporter=@saucelabs/playwright-reporter
```
